Is this also available for offline use?
    Yes, you can download `gh-pages.zip
    <https://github.com/lazka/pgi-docs/archive/gh-pages.zip>`__ (~30 MB),
    extract it and open the `index.html` file with Firefox or Chrome.

    In case of Chrome/Chromium ``--allow-file-access-from-files`` has to be
    passed on start to enable all features also available in the online
    version.

Can I use this documentation with Devhelp?
    Yes, see `pgi-docs-devhelp <https://github.com/pygobject/pgi-docs-devhelp>`__.

I want to know how to write GTK+ applications...
    Check out the `Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial <https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/>`__.

Why is library <XYZ> not included? How can I use library <XYZ> mentioned here, it's not available for my distro?
    This API reference includes all libraries included in Debian
    testing/unstable. If the library you need is missing it might not be in
    Debian yet or is no longer included because it no longer has any users in
    Debian.

    I use Debian as a source because it tracks upstream GNOME reasonably fast
    while still including libraries that are not part of GNOME.
